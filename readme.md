# üïπÔ∏è Unity 2D Platformer Game

Welcome to **Project J**, a thrilling 2D platformer developed in Unity! Navigate through challenging levels, avoid obstacles, defeat enemies, and collect power-ups as you make your way to the goal.


## üéÆ Game Overview

In **Project J**, players control a character in a side-scrolling world filled with various levels, enemies, and puzzles. The objective is to reach the end of each level while overcoming obstacles, battling enemies, and collecting items to improve your abilities.

Additionally, the game features an **experience system**, allowing the player to earn experience points (XP) by defeating enemies and completing objectives. As the player levels up, they can invest in upgrading their stats, such as **health (HP)** or **damage output**, making the character more resilient or powerful in combat. This progression system adds depth to the gameplay, giving players more control over their character's development and encouraging replayability.

- **Tight Controls**: Fluid and responsive controls for precise movement and action.
- **Power-Ups and Collectibles**: Gather power-ups to gain special abilities and collectibles to unlock bonuses.
